This program sends a Push notification to a registered device using the Parse REST Api

Requirments: 

	- Application Id Key
	- Rest Api Key
	- Registered Device Id

This program will only work when there is an application that is configured to accept incoming push notifications, along with a registered user and device to receive the notifications. 

I wrote this because I wanted to test out sending Pushes using the Parse Rest Api.
